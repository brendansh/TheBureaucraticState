### Whereas You Are To Become A Body Politic

> The Pilgrims thought themselves at full liberty without any charter from the crown, to establish such sort of government as they thought proper, and to form a new state as full to all intents and purposes as if they had been in a state of nature, and were making their first entrance into civil society.

> The Mayflower Compact was the first example in modern times of a social contract or system of government instituted by voluntary agreement, conformably to the laws of nature, by men of equal rights, and about to establish their community in a new country.

Americans today, two hundred years after the Revolution, have not only largely forgotten the Republic, which was once thought of as being unique, as "the last best hope of mankind,' " but the United States has evolved to the extent that there may be no real relationship between the Old Republie of 1776-1860 and the America of the 1970's, notwithstanding the preservation of the Federal framework and the Constitution. What relationship is there, after all, between the Jeffersonian America Tocqueville visited in the 1830's, "the image of democracy itself," in which "a democracy more perfeet than antiquity had dared to dream of started in full size and panoply," and the America of the 1970's, as a bureaucratic state and a mass society. What relationship is there between the America of the 1850's, with its common republican political structures, in which the citizens could rally overnight to oppose the nationalization of slavery, and a bureaucratic America in which the citizens have nothing in common but the common concrete wilderness of our cities and urban suburbs, where "closely packed human beings" live isolated from one another in that "weird irreality that human relationships assume wherever they develop in absolute worldlessness, unrelated to a world common to all people." The United States was transformed, largely as a result of conditions in the South and massive immigration in the North after the Civil War, from a democratic republic into a bureaucratic state and mass society in the years between the 1890's and the 1920's, (and, as a consequence, Americans have largely forgotten the Old Republic and lost contact with the republican political tradition,) but, 

today, given the general equality of condition that has existed since the 1940's, as well as the enfranchisement of the black community in the 1960's, America has once again become a (relatively) equalitarian society. It has once again become possible, therefore, to discuss freedom and self-government in principle in America - a discussion which has not been held in the last half-century, and one that has not been properly held since Tocqueville wrote about America in the 1830's. 

**A NEW SCIENCE OF POLITICS IS NEEDED FOR A NEW WORLD** 

> Whereas you are to become a body politic using amongst yourself civil government, and are not furnished with any persons of special eminency above the rest to be chosen by you into office of government, let your wisdom and godliness appear, not only in choosing such persons as do entirely love and will promote the common good, but also yielding them all due honor and obedience in their lawful administration.

>**PASTOR JOHN ROBINSON, 1620**

 > Now, I know of only two methods of establishing equality in the political world, rights must be given to every citizen, or to none at all. Without power and independence a town may have good subjects, but it can have no active citizens.

 > **TOCQUEVILLE** 
 
 Tocqueville, after visiting America in 1831-1832, and finding that nothing struck him more "forcibly" than the "general equality of condition among the people," the "fundamental fact from which all others seem to be derived," called for "a new science of politics" for "a new world." in which freedom would be established (or preserved) in equalitarian or democratic societies. In Europe, he wrote, equalitarianism had been "abandoned to its wild instincts," to despotism, but in America the settlers and founders "had somehow separated the democratic principles from all the principles they had to contend with in the old communities of Europe, and transplanted it alone to the New World," where self-government "'has been able to speak in perfect freedom and peaceably to determine the character and laws by influencing the manners of the country. Tocqueville encountered (or discovered) freedom or self-government established in a democratic society, and the model for his new science of politics, in the local communities and towns of the American Republic, where every "village" formed "a sort of republic" within the federal republic, but especially in the laws of New England, where he found the "germ and gradual development of that township independence" which was the "life and mainspring of American liberty." "It is not without intention," he wrote, "that I begin this subject (of freedom] with the township." The township was the foundation stone of the new science of free politics because it institutionalized local democracy or self-goverment, for, "as men who live in democratic societies are not connected with each other by any tie," the
